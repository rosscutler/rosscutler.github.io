## Welcome to my personal webpage

I'm an Applied Scientist manager at Microsoft. I've been with Microsoft since 2000, joining Microsoft Research as a researcher after completing my Ph.D. in computer vision at the University of Maryland. In this page I'll include brief descriptions of some of the projects I've worked on, which have mostly been in the telecommunication domain - a very rich and satisfying area for applied research.

You can find more info about me in my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosscutler) and my [Microsoft Research page]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcutler).

## Projects
Below are some of the projects I've worked on.

### ML speech enhancement
The goal of this project is to replace the DSP-based speech enhancement components in Teams/Skype with better performing ML-based models. To do so we first created scaleable crowdsourcing framework to rate 100's of thousands of clips cheaply and accurately. We created massive training and test sets to enable training ML models. We built the first accurate (PCC > 0.95) non-intrusive speech quality assessment models for speech in the presense of noise, echo, packetloss, and PSTN distortions. We then created the first academic challenges for noise suppression, echo cancellation, and packet loss concealment. Finally the models we built were integrated into Teams/Skype and AB tested to show significant end-to-end improvement.
