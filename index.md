## Welcome to my personal webpage

I'm an Applied Scientist manager at Microsoft. I've been with Microsoft since 2000, joining Microsoft Research as a researcher after completing my Ph.D. in computer vision at the University of Maryland. In this page I'll include brief descriptions of some of the projects I've worked on, which have mostly been in the telecommunication domain - a very rich and satisfying area for applied research.

You can find more info about me in my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosscutler) and my [Microsoft Research page]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcutler).
